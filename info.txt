Thinking about how we could bootstrap a new OS onto a new controller or an old Jessie or Buster one. I think we could use a PXE boot process to completely reinstall an OS onto the mSATA and re partition the disks as required. 

PCEngines BIOS already has IPXE configured as a boot target, we would probably have to build a custom IPXE image and rebuild the PCEngines BIOS firmware to include it but they we could configure that custom IPXE image to download the main OS image from a Vocovo webserver via HTTPS authenticated somehow.
